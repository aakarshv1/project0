This web page is about the sport of tennis. Index.html is the home page and contains a 
basic description of the sport as well as an image of a tennis racket, ball, and court. 
The title of the page utilizes the bootstrap jumbotron component. Players.html contains 
a table of the 5 best tennis players of the 21st Century (in my opinion) and some 
information about them. The title of the page utilizes a media query that shortens the title
when the viewport is shortened past a threshold. Rules.html contains an unordered list 
that mentions the basic rules of tennis. History.html uses the bootstrap columns and grid layout
to create a timeline of major events in the history of the sport. All 4 pages contain a "navigation
box" in the top right that contains links to each of the other three pages. When the web page
is printed, the navigation box disappears through the use of a media query.
