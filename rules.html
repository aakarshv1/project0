    <h1>General Rules of Tennis</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>A ball must land within bounds for play to continue; if a player hits the ball outside of bounds, this results in the loss of the point for them.</li>
        <li>Players/teams cannot touch the net or posts or cross onto the opponentâ€™s side.</li>
        <li>Players/teams cannot carry the ball or catch it with the racquet.</li>
        <li>Players cannot hit the ball twice.</li>
        <li>Players must wait until the ball passes the net before they can return it.</li>
        <li>A player that does not return a live ball before it bounces twice loses the point.</li>
        <li>If the ball hits or touches the players, that counts as a penalty.</li>
        <li>If the racquet leaves the hand or verbal abuse occurs, a penalty is given.</li>
        <li>Any ball that bounces on the lines of boundary are considered good.</li>
        <li>A serve must bounce first before the receiving player can return it.</li
    </ul>
